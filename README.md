manatee-cms
===========

This project is about creating a simple component-based cms in node.js.

Currently, the project is in a very early development stage and is still a huge mess code-wise.

TODO:
 - Refactor enough so that modules are really... modular.
 - Add the ability to create pages
 - Add the ability to edit pages
 - Add the ability to delete pages
 - Add unit tests for alot of the code


Not-so-much musthaves but should be created:
 - Add the ability to define content-documents outside of the page
